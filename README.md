# Golden Hour: AI-Powered Emergency Response for India

**Mission**: Save 50,000-100,000 lives annually by compressing the emergency response timeline from hours to seconds through voice-first AI coordination.

## The Problem

- **2.4 million Indians die annually** from treatable conditions
- Only **7% of trauma patients** reach hospitals within the golden hour (vs 50% in USA)
- **50% of road accident deaths** (150,000-270,000 annually) are preventable with golden hour care
- **700,000 cardiac arrests/year**, 80% outside hospitals, 2-10% survival rate
- **58,000 snakebite deaths/year** — 77% die before reaching care

**This is a coordination failure, not a capability failure.** The treatments exist. The hospitals exist. The ambulances exist. What's missing is the orchestration layer that connects them.

## The Solution

A mobile app where users tap one button, speak in any language, and AI handles everything from transcription to dispatch — with no human bottleneck.

### How It Works

1. **The Incident (0-60s)**: User taps emergency button, speaks in any language. AI transcribes, triages, geolocates, and identifies the nearest *appropriate* facility simultaneously.
2. **The Dispatch (60-90s)**: AI dispatches multiple pathways in parallel — 108 ambulance, hospital notification, first responders, family alerts.
3. **The Bridge (while waiting)**: AI stays on the line guiding bystanders through CPR or first aid, monitoring symptoms, building a real-time medical record.
4. **The Handoff**: Arriving responders receive a structured packet. Receiving hospital is already prepped.

## Active build: `web/` (Next.js + Vercel AI SDK)

The current product is in [`web/`](web/README.md). It uses Next.js 16, the
Vercel AI SDK v6, and Claude Haiku 4.5 as a single tool-calling agent for
voice → triage → hospital matching → parallel WhatsApp dispatch. The Python
/ CrewAI scaffold under `src/` is superseded but kept for reference.

```bash
cd web && npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # or use ../.env at the repo root
npm run dev                  # → http://localhost:4005
```

End-to-end real integrations as of 2026-04:
- **Voice**: Web Speech API (English, live transcript) + Sarvam `saaras:v2.5` (Hindi/Tamil/Telugu/Kannada → English)
- **GPS**: browser geolocation with Peoria, IL fallback
- **Hospitals**: live Google Places API (New) + region-aware seeds (Bangalore, Peoria) + Jaccard token matching
- **Dispatch**: real Twilio WhatsApp (with `DEMO_WHATSAPP_OVERRIDE_TO` for single-phone demos)
- **Triage**: `generateObject` + Zod → ESI level, capabilities, time criticality, first-aid

See [`web/README.md`](web/README.md) for full setup.
