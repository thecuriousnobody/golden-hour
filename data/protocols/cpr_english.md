# CPR Voice Guidance Protocol

## Check for Response
- "Can you hear me? Tap the person's shoulder firmly."
- "Are they responding? Are they breathing normally?"

## If Unresponsive and Not Breathing

### Step 1: Call for Help
- "Help is already on the way. I need you to start CPR now."

### Step 2: Position
- "Lay the person flat on their back on a hard surface."
- "Kneel beside their chest."

### Step 3: Hand Placement
- "Place the heel of one hand on the center of their chest, right between the nipples."
- "Place your other hand on top, fingers interlocked."

### Step 4: Compressions
- "Push hard and fast. Press down at least 2 inches."
- "Push at a rate of 100 to 120 times per minute."
- "Let the chest come all the way back up between pushes."
- "Do not stop compressions unless you are too exhausted to continue."

### Timing Cues
- "Push push push push push..." (at 100-120 BPM rhythm)
- "Keep going, you're doing great."
- "Don't stop. Help is coming."

### Every 2 Minutes
- "Is the person showing any signs of life? Any movement or breathing?"
- "If not, keep going with compressions."

## If Person Starts Breathing
- "They're breathing! Roll them onto their side."
- "Keep watching them. Tell me if anything changes."

## Important Notes
- Do NOT stop to check for a pulse if untrained
- Compression-only CPR is acceptable for untrained bystanders
- If an AED is available, use it immediately
